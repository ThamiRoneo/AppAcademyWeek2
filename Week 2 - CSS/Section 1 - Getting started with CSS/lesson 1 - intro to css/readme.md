## What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS is a simple design language that we use to make web pages beautiful and presentable.

Using CSS, you can set colours, fonts, and background images.
CSS is different from HTML, and they both serve completely different functions. Using HTML you create the structure of your page, and with CSS you add colors and styles to your page.
