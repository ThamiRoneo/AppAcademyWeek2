You make your lists look like the one from lesson 4 by using the list-style-image property.
Using list-style-iamge is similar to adding an iamge into your page.

First, you need an image in your images folder that will be your bullet.
Next, you type the link to the image into your stylesheet.
You also need to remember that your image needs to be small enough to serve as a bullet.
